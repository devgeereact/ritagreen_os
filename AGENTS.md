# ritagreen_os Agent Contract

This existing project adopts the active shared GEE OS, minimum version 0.5.0. Read `.agent/PROJECT.yml` and `.agent/CURRENT-TASK.md`, then apply the constitution, loop and routing rules at `~/.agents/gee-os`.

## Read order

1. `AGENTS.md`, this shared entry point.
2. `.agent/PROJECT.yml`, project routing and risk.
3. `.agent/CURRENT-TASK.md`, current scope and evidence.
4. `CLAUDE.md`, preserved project knowledge pending modularisation.
5. `README.md` and the relevant files under `docs/`.

## Shared rules

- Select one primary mode and load only relevant systems, workflows, skills and MCP rules.
- Preserve established business rules, architecture and user work.
- Treat documentation as evidence to verify against real code and behaviour.
- Apply the change safety protocol before modifying existing behaviour.
- Never claim fixed, secure, accessible or ready without matching evidence.
- Keep remote and production changes outside scope unless the current user authorises them explicitly.
- MCP and skill availability never expands user authority.

## Migration note

The existing `CLAUDE.md` remains intact during the first adoption wave. Its content will be classified and moved only after a project-specific review identifies the correct source of truth for each fact.
