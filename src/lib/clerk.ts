/**
 * Clerk bridge for non-React code (lib/api.ts, the auth provider).
 *
 * Sign-in is Clerk (email code). Clerk's session token is short-lived, so it is fetched fresh for
 * each request via the getter registered by <ClerkSession/>. When VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
 * is not set the app keeps the existing email-and-password flow, so a build without the key still works.
 *
 * Roles never come from Clerk: the PHP API verifies the token and returns the staff record
 * (auth.php?action=me), exactly as before.
